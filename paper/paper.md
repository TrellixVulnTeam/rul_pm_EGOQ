# Summary

Efficient management of maintenance in modern industrial environments is having 
a major impact on decreasing costs associated with defective products and 
equipment inactivity. Therefore, it is critical for companies to develop an 
efficient and well-implemented maintenance strategy to prevent unexpected outages, 
improve overall reliability, and reduce operating costs  \cite{8748978}.


Traditional manufacturing has been transformed into factories with intelligent 
sensors that enable better understanding of what happens during the industrial 
processes as a result of the development of information systems. Industry 4.0 
refers to this innovative approach to conceptualizing industrial processes. 
According to this new idea, all the data gathered can be used to enhance 
decision-making procedures. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) techniques have replaced 
Preventive Maintenance (PM) techniques as a result of the use of this information 
in maintenance processes, according \cite{damant2021exploring}. PM is done on a 
regular basis while the asset is still functional to avoid unplanned breakdowns. 
Contrarily, PdM can statistically evaluate a piece of equipment's health status, 
enabling early identification of impending failures and prompt pre-failure 
interventions, thanks to prediction tools based on historical data \cite{susto2014machine}. 
 
The remaining useful life (RUL) estimation has been considered as a central 
technology of PdM \cite{heimes2008recurrent} \cite{li2018remaining}. 
RUL estimation is a process that uses prediction methods to forecast the 
future performance of machinery and obtain the time left before machinery loses 
its operation ability.
